The copper price data used in this study were obtained from Macrotrends, a widely recognized platform that compiles long-term historical prices of global commodities. The dataset contains daily spot prices for COMEX copper, covering the period from January 2010 to October 2023. The data were accessed by navigating to the “Metals” → “Copper” section and downloaded via the cloud-shaped download icon (see Copper_Price.png for reference). The original data file, named "03_chart_20250721T111149.csv", is stored in the project directory "01_Data/03_Raw_original_data".

The original unit is US dollars per pound (USD/lb) and the data are reported at daily frequency. To ensure consistency with other time series variables, the daily prices were aggregated into monthly medians, thereby enhancing robustness against extreme values and aligning with the temporal structure of the model.

All procedures related to data processing—such as logarithmic transformation, lag construction, and integration into various models—are fully documented in the project's "02_Scripts" directory.

Copper price is treated as a primary exogenous explanatory variable in this study. Its fluctuations are considered a proxy for the market return of scrap copper, thereby providing an economically grounded incentive framework for copper cable theft. The inclusion of this variable is theoretically motivated and empirically validated in previous literature.
